Front-end implementation of a steganography suite using Steganography.js. 

This is my final project for my cybersecurity bootcamp. I created my own basic front-end version of a steganography suite because I wanted to understand what was going on under the hood when you use something like Steghide in Linux. Steganography.JS library can be found <a href=https://www.peter-eigenschink.at/projects/steganographyjs>here</a>. Using the minified version of the file I created a basic steganography suite and then to make it come alive for my class, I coded an additional website using the steganography suite as a driver to solve riddles to unlock a lock. 

Included here are the steganography suite under the title of Hidden Messages, the riddle websited with the title of Unlock Your Curiosity, and the slide deck I created for presenting my project.
